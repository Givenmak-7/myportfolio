    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-container">

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of the Witwatersrand with a strong academic and practical foundation in software development, data analytics, and problem-solving. I am an analytical thinker and lifelong learner who is passionate about applying technology to solve real-world challenges in business, education, and community-focused environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring a balance of technical capability, leadership experience, and strong communication skills, developed through academic projects, internships, tutoring roles, and collaborative team environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Education & Academic Focus</h3>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of the Witwatersrand (2025) and am currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the same institution. My academic background includes programming, algorithms, data structures, databases, and analytical problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been recognized for academic excellence, achieving distinctions in Database Fundamentals and Introduction to Algorithms and Programming. These experiences strengthened my ability to design efficient solutions and approach problems logically.
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Skills & Interests</h3>
      <p>
        My technical skill set spans both software development and data analytics. I have experience working with Python, Java, and C++, as well as tools such as Power BI, Excel, Power Query, and basic DAX. I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building user-focused applications that prioritize clarity and usability.
      </p>

      <h3>Professional & Practical Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I completed a virtual internship with SAGEA as part of the Quantify Your Future (QYF) programme, where I worked on real-world data analysis projects aligned with South Africa’s skills and labour market challenges. I analyzed Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) data to investigate student enrolment trends, graduation outcomes, and skills alignment, producing structured, evidence-based insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the University of the Witwatersrand, I served as an Academic Tutor for Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms and Basic Computer Organisation. I also worked as a Lead Student Mentor, supporting students with academic adjustment, time management, and personal development. These roles strengthened my communication, leadership, and mentoring abilities.
      </p>

      <h3>Projects & Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        I have worked on several technical projects, including a Power BI Sales Insights Dashboard, a responsive school website built with React and Tailwind CSS, and a final-year Event Planner web application where I served as Project Manager and Documentation Lead. These projects required a combination of technical implementation, Agile coordination, and clear documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also participated in the Adapt IT Social Good Hackathon and AWS Cloudathon, contributing to the frontend development of a mobile application aimed at connecting disadvantaged communities with freelancing opportunities.
      </p>

      <h3>Career Goals</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently seeking entry-level or graduate opportunities in software development, data analytics, or technology-focused roles where I can continue learning, contribute meaningfully, and grow professionally in collaborative environments.
      </p>
